## Implementation
### The Model

...

### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

...

#### The `N` hyperparameter

...

#### The `dt` hyperparameter

...

### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

...

### Model Predictive Control with Latency

...

## Simulation
### The vehicle must successfully drive a lap around the track.

I run several tests in the simulator. I recorded two full laps and uploaded the results to Youtube:
